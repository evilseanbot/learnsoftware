learn software!
=============

A syllabus of sorts for my friends who are interested in learning software in january

**Resources**

http://www.w3schools.com/ <- I've found the references to be very useful, I don't have any personal expierience with the tutorials.

http://www.codecademy.com/ <- Represent a good place to start if you don't have any prior knowledge. Might be too simple or slow for some. Learn what you need to and work on a project!

http://jsfiddle.net/ <- A good way to share and test simple web code
