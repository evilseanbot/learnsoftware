learn software!
=============

A syllabus of sorts for my friends who are interested in learning software in january

**Resources**

http://www.w3schools.com/ <- I've found the references to be very useful, I don't have any personal expierience with the tutorials.

http://www.codecademy.com/ <- Represent a good place to start if you don't have any prior knowledge. Might be too simple or slow for some. Learn what you need to and work on a project!

http://jsfiddle.net/ <- A good way to share and test simple web code

**What You Should Do Right Now**

Learn whether you love coding or not.

If you love coding, I strongly encourage becoming great at it, because being a software engineer is one of the few great low-risk career options right now.

If you don't love coding, I would suggest not trying to become a software engineer, but you should try to become *adequate* at basic web/software engineering as its widely useful for a variety of endeavors, whether you're interested in game design, research, graphic design, other fields of engineering, marketing, etc.
